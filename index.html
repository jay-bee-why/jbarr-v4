    <h1>Hey, I'm Justin. I'm a designer that specializes in defining products and
      user experiences.</h1>
    <p>
      I have over a decade of experience working at the intersection of design,
      business, and technology. I've worked with startups and enterprise brands alike
      to create user-centered experiences, establish visual design systems, prototype
      and test products, and mentor teams on Agile and Lean practices.
      I live in sunny Los Angeles.
